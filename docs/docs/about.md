# About the Project

An explanation of the proposed assignment project before the we present the project results.

## Assignment
The developed website and api is for the course M7011E at LTU. It a project course where we are supposed to learn more about dynamic webb development using existing knowledge and industri standrad. 

We had different topics that were graduated, being more explained below, but the most important part was the learning process and taking advantage of the industry standard to build on our existing knowledge.

### API
For the development of the API we were specified to provide a specific standard. We choosed to used Restful API and document it with swagger. 

We would also convey a more graphic sketch of the intended system and how it was should to work.

See more detailed information about the API on the next page.
